# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
Project Goal is to download the available data set 30,478 Airbnb listings in New York City. Upload the data into Tableau and build at least 5 different visualizations to learn more about the dataset. Also, look for some interesting trends and patterns, clusterring and forecasting. 
Present the collected data.

## Process
### 1
From the horizontal bar above we can see the following:
1. Room types on Airbnb in New York: Entire house/apartment, private room and shared room
2. Airbnb data in New York is divided between 5 neighbourhoods: Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, Staten Island. Each neighbourhood is assigned a different color. 
From the bars above we can see that the most expensive room type is entire house/apartment and its located in the Staten Island. Manhattan is the second on the list. The lowest average price for rent is for the shared room in Bronx.  
### 2
From the charts above we can see the following:
The highest number of reviews had been received by a private house/apartment in Manhattan in June 2012.  I think it do to the following reasons:
1. Popularity of Manhattan around the world plus the summer when a lot of people take vacations and travel around the world.
2. The location: its close to the center and all main attractions
There are properties in Bronx and Queens that have 0 reviews. I think its because of the location and the season, mostly winter of late fall.
### 3
From the pie chart beside its easy to see that the most popular room type to rent on Airbnb is entire house or apartment. This room type has the most number of reviews, 205,714 reviews which is about 56,16%. The least popular option is a private room, which has 153,152 reviews. The less used option is shared room, with 7,441 reviews which is about 2,03%. I think it has something to do with COVID trends as well. 
### 4
Here is a quick map with the properties that people rent out in New York. Its colored based on the neighbourhoods and Zipcodes. Also, the number of each properties available .
### 5
My Dashboard includes data on:
 - AVG price per room type and neighbourhood
 - Host reviews and the date since the property was hosted
 - Room type popularity
 - Number of Airbnb properties in New York.

It's also possible to filter the Dashboard elements by selecting the appropriate little filer sign on the side

## Results
AIRBNB is a leading website in the world, where people can book rooms, beds, houses and etc. for short and long term. AIRBNB provides a platform for small businesses and individuals to rent out the above spaces without large investments or major channels. Airbnb provides an opportunity to book or reserve a place to stay at much competitive prices comparing to the hotels. Also, places to stay in the areas where hotels are not available.
The success of Airbnb shows that there is a number of people willing to rent out part of their property to help pay for the mortgage. The fact that itâ€™s often cheaper than hotels helps the demand.
56% - Percentage of rented private houses/apartments in New York. Private Rooms are on the second place at 41%

5,886 - The highest number of reviews per property: 5,886 comments for a property in Manhattan, room type: apartment

## Challenges 
1. From the data available, I was not able to see information on trends like, booking from people who live in the USA or internatioanl tourists
2. If I have more time and data I would explore more things like negative or positive reviews, number of customers that booked the particular property more than once 

## Future Goals
Add some Analytics on the trend with number of bedroom that are beeing rented out. Also, more information on the individual incomes for each property.
